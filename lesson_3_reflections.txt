When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When colaborating with others, or releasing your code to the public. Also just to keep a cloud based version of your code available for you to access on other machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	When working collaboratively you may want to only want to update to a version at certain points in time, like before starting work on a new part of the code. You wouldn't want somebody else to push something that breaks what you're working on.

Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of the other?
	A fork copies somebody else's github repo into a repo of your own. Good for when you want to make changes of your own to somebody else's project, and keep it separate from the original project. Clones copy a repo from github to your local, good for when you need to actually work on something at all, as modifying code through the github web interface would be a nightmare. Branches are when you want to have 2 versions of the same project being committed in parallel to one another, potentially for adding a feature that you don't want affecting the master branch until after it's complete.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	It allows you to work offline and still be able to see the changes that may have been made more recently than the last time you pulled.
